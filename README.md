# pfdmaker
a fairly simple python gui to make process flow diagrams (pfds) and other simple drawings with tikzpictures. 

### intro

pfds are a useful tool in visualizing physical processes, but making them with tikzpictures is very annoying. This project works at making them as easily as you'd edit a google slide show or something. The benefit of using tikzpictures/latex is that the diagram will be rendered as a vector graphic so you can zoom in without losing image quality.

### how to use

open `tikz.py` !
